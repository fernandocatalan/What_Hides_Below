    figure the thing out. Now, it brings me no pride to say this either, but that was 2 days ago, and we've hardly
    gotten anywhere."

    Only now I got to the point where I was just waiting on 'em to get back to me."

    sheriff "I couldn't stand sitting idly by as the clock ticked down, so I figured I'd pull out all the
    stops and that's when I called you in."

    could give me at all?"

    the way sayin' he figured somethin' out about the map. You should talk to him first."
