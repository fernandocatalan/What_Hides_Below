    yn "Not much one for organization eh?"

    sheriff "Organization is a luxury I wish I could afford the time for. Look here."

    "He pushes aside some scattered papers and sets down two files, one looking rather thicker than the other. He
    holds up the thicker folder."

    sheriff "Essentially, we've been working on a particular case for a few months now. A serial killer is on the
    loose, bodies turn up every so often and we've been running circles trying to catch the perpetrator. I've got
    all hands on deck for this."

    "I'd heard wind about this in passing on the news the past few months. Though the station hasn't made a statement
    on being this clueless. Must be all the red tape at work."

    "I flip open the folder and see notes on the victims. 5 bodies, always in plastic bags out of town. Nothing new
    in here that I hadn't already heard from the news though."

    yn "So this is where I come in then?"

    sheriff "Well, yes, but not quite."

    "He holds up the other, lighter file."

    sheriff "A couple hours ago, we recieved a phone call. Our operator answered as usual, assuming it was a typical
    emergency, but then the voice behind the call only said one thing. \"Check the front door. Game start.\""

    sheriff "The call dropped right after, and the operator immediately notified an officer on the situation. My
    deputy was the one to check it out, and found a single envelope on our doorstep. What's in the file is everything
    that was in that envelope."

    "I give him a confused glance as I reached for the folder."

    "I flip the folder open and all I see on it is a single note."

    #An image for the note will appear here
    "The note shows large \"X's\" on what appears to be a crudely drawn map, and some haunting words
    accompany it below."

    "{color=#8b0000}You have 5 days. Play my game, or get ready to pack another body."

    yn "Oh good grief..."

    sheriff "Not a trace of who could have left it there either. Cameras only saw a hooded figure, but we couldn't
    even tell where they had ran off to."

    sheriff "Soon as I confirmed it wasn't some sort of sick joke from someone here, we got to work on trying to
    figure the thing out."

    sheriff "However, just then we got yet another call. We got tipped off that a suspicious individual had just been
    seen at the library, and they matched descriptions of a suspicious indivudal that appeared shortly before the 5
    other bodies turned up."

    yn "Two suspicious individuals at two different locations. So that means.."

    sheriff "We've got 2 cases on our hands now. Whether it's a copy cat that got inspired, or it's just a freak
    coincidence, I don't know. But we've got our hands more full than ever."

    sheriff "And now THAT'S where you come in."

    sheriff "See, I already had all officers here busy on the first case, and suddenly our workload just doubled.
    But we don't have the manpower to tackle both of these, especially with the clock ticking the way it is."

    sheriff "So, I know you have the knowhow and capabilities of my entire station as a one man army. So here's
    your part in this."

    "The sheriff sets both folders down in the table in front of him and slides them toward me."

    sheriff "Detective [name], I need you to take one of these cases while the rest of my team deals with the other.
    With this new lead, and two forces working as one, I'm confident we can put a lid on this fire before it spirals
    even further out of control."

    yn "So you want me to choose between the two? Why not choose for me? I imagine you'd be better equipped to handle
    the first case than I would."

    sheriff "We think the perpetrator has been alluding us because they've grown savvy to our methods of
    investigation. {i}You{/i} could be the new edge needed to crack the case."

    sheriff "Though if you don't choose this one, then the lead we just got could also give us enough track them
    down for good. But the point is we'd have another force on the case."

    yn "But then what of the second case?"

    sheriff "We're just as in the know about it as you are, truth be told. But you have the benefit of being a fresh
    face that this new perpetrator might not expect. Either way, you have an edge and we could use that in either
    case. And so, the option is there."

    sheriff "Know that whichever you choose, not all of my officers will be able to help you. You'll at best have my
    and my deputies' support at times, everyone else will be too busy with the other case to help."

    he's not wrong about this being a pressing matter. Guess I have to make a choice here..."
